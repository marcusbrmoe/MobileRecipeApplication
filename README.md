# Mobile Recipe Application

## Description
This project was created by Marcus Moe as a part of the Mobile Programming course.
The mobile application's purpose is to search and filter among many available resipes. All recipes can be individually "opened" and viewed. Each recipe will have a nutrition page with two graphs/charts. I will utilize a REST API provided by Edamam. Firebase Realtime database will also be used for saving "favorite" recipes.
